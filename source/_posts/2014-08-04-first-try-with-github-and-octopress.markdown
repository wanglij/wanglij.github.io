It's been many years that I've hardly written something. Once in a while, it's like something was tucked in you mind, and you just feel not right if you don't put it down somewhere. However, it's hard to find a place to do this for sort of geek person like me. My favorable editor is vim, and I like the pages to be neat and concise. Thank my friend, feipeng's help, I got this in github. This looks cool. I hope I am able to feel at home with it, and share something here soon.

This is the first shot, and also a first test/practice.
