<p>It&rsquo;s been many years that I hardly written something. Once in a while, it&rsquo;s like something was tucked in you mind, and you just feel not right if you don&rsquo;t put it down somewhere. However, it&rsquo;s hard to find a place to do this for sort of geek person like me. My favorable editor is vim, and I like the pages to be neat and concise. Thank my friend, feipeng&rsquo;s help, I got this in github. This looks cool. I hope I am able to feel at home with it, and share something here soon.</p>

<p>This is the first shot, and also a first test/practice.</p>
